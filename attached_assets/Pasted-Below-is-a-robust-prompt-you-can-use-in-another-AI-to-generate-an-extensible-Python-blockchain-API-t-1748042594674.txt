Create a Python script that serves as a robust and extendable blockchain API template. The template should be designed to offer a solid foundation for further development and eventual integration with web frameworks (such as Flask or FastAPI). Include not only the basic blockchain functionalities but also advanced options and additional capabilities. The script must adhere to the following requirements:

1. **Core Blockchain Functionality:**
   - **Blockchain Class:**  
     - Initialize the blockchain with an empty chain.
     - Automatically create a genesis block upon instantiation (use a fixed proof like 1 and a previous hash of "0").
   - **Block Structure:**  
     Each block should be represented as a dictionary containing:
       - `index`: The sequential number of the block.
       - `timestamp`: The date and time when the block is created.
       - `proof`: The proof value obtained from the Proof of Work algorithm.
       - `previous_hash`: The SHA-256 hash of the previous block.
       - *(Optional)* Include a `transactions` field to store a list of transactions if available.
   - **Block Hashing Method:**  
     Create a method that receives a block (as a dictionary) and returns its SHA-256 hash. Ensure the block is serialized in a consistent way (e.g., using JSON with sorted keys).

2. **Proof of Work Algorithm:**
   - Implement a proof-of-work method where:
     - The method accepts the previous proof.
     - It iterates over candidate numbers (starting from 1) until it finds a number such that the SHA-256 hash of the operation (for example, new_proof² - previous_proof²) produces a hash that starts with a specified number of leading zeros (e.g., “0000”).
   - Provide an option for the difficulty to be adjusted via a configuration variable.

3. **Blockchain Validation:**
   - Create a method to validate the entire blockchain.
   - Check that:
     - The `previous_hash` of each block matches the computed hash of the previous block.
     - The proof-of-work value for each block is valid by recalculating the hash based on the block's and previous block’s proof.

4. **Transaction Management (Advanced Option):**
   - Include an optional mechanism to add transactions.
   - Maintain a list of transactions that will be inserted into the next block.
   - Create a method to add a new transaction (with parameters such as sender, receiver, and amount).
   - Optionally, clear the transaction pool upon the creation of a new block.

5. **Network and Node Management (Advanced Option):**
   - Provide methods to register and store other nodes in the network.
   - Implement (or outline) a consensus algorithm that chooses the longest valid blockchain among the connected nodes.
   - Include methods to:
     - Add a node's address.
     - Retrieve and resolve conflicts between different blockchain versions from various nodes.

6. **Logging and Error Handling:**
   - Integrate logging functionality to report key events (e.g., block creation, proof-of-work results, validation errors).
   - Add error handling to manage invalid inputs or corrupted blocks gracefully.
   - Include comments on where further debugging or log enhancements might be added.

7. **API Integration-Ready:**
   - While no actual API endpoints are required, design the code with clear separation of concerns.
   - Outline places where API endpoints could be added later, using placeholders for integration with frameworks like Flask or FastAPI.
   - Ensure the code is modular so that the blockchain logic can be exposed via HTTP endpoints in the future.

8. **User Demonstration:**
   - In the main execution block (`if __name__ == "__main__":`), demonstrate:
     - Instantiation of the Blockchain.
     - Creation of the genesis block.
     - Adding a few additional blocks.
     - Optionally, demonstrate adding transactions before mining a new block.
     - Printing of blocks and the overall blockchain.
     - Running the chain validation and displaying the result.

9. **Code Documentation and Extensibility:**
   - Include comprehensive docstrings and inline comments for every class, method, and important code block.
   - Provide clear instructions within the code on how to extend or modify functionalities (e.g., adding digital signatures, persistent storage, or a more sophisticated consensus mechanism).

10. **Dependencies:**
    - The script should be self-contained and only rely on Python’s standard libraries (e.g., datetime, hashlib, json, logging).
    - Mention that integration with third-party libraries (for persistence or API endpoints) can be done later.

Output the complete Python script as a runnable, self-contained file that is well-organized and structured for future extensions.
